I prefer the next apps that need to be installed manually

## Communication

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - facebook open sourced text editor

## Proxies
* [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) - a beutiful proxy app for development

## Synchronization
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) - a nice to have synchronization app, that's easy to use

## Git
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - nice git management tool, I usually use git from command line, but that tool allow you to review the changes very easily and nicely
